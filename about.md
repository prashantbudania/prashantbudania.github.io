I am pursuing a Masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University with a May 2018 anticipated completion date. My research focus is on using machine learning in imaging and artificial intelligence. I am seeking to leverage my current research experience, the knowledge I gained from past internships and graduate coursework in ECE to pursue an internship in imaging, machine learning and artificial intelligence field.

Most recently, I worked as a research engineer in Indian Institute of Technology Delhi on a medical imaging project, where I worked on developing a robust algorithm to remove noise in temporal DCE-MRI data and on detecting, segmenting different tissues in SWI and classifying them based on perfusion parameters. I have also worked on image segmentation, retrieval problems. Additionally, I have an experience in design of a low cost, non-invasive NIR optical device to detect breast cancers.
