I am pursuing a Masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University with a May 2018 anticipated completion date. My research focus is on using machine learning in natural language processing field. I am seeking to leverage my current research experience, the knowledge I gained from past internships and graduate coursework in ECE to get full-time job opportunities in deep learning, artificial intelligence and natural language processing field.

Most recently, I was working as Research Assistant in Machine Learning Department, where I contributed to the field of natural language processing. As part of the research work, I designed and developed two neural network based architectures for autocoding industry and occupation text pairs for Centre for Disease Control. In addition, I was involved in several other projects, including improving visual attention for caption generation, proposing a new weighting strategy for identifying question pairs with similar intent and proposing a novel application of RNNs for multi-label classification on hierarchical label space.

I have also worked as a research engineer in Indian Institute of Technology Delhi on a medical imaging project, where I worked on developing a robust algorithm to remove noise in temporal DCE-MRI data and on detecting, segmenting different tissues in SWI and classifying them based on perfusion parameters. Additionally, I have an experience in designing a low cost, non-invasive NIR optical device to detect breast cancers.
